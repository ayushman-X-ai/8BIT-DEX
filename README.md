# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Push your code to a Git repository:** Create a new repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and push your local code to it.
2.  **Import your project into Vercel:** Go to your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project", and import the Git repository you just created.
3.  **Deploy:** Vercel will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and configure the build settings. You can add environment variables if needed. Click "Deploy".

Your app will be live in a few moments!

**Note:** This project contains an `apphosting.yaml` file which is used for Firebase App Hosting. You can safely ignore or delete this file when deploying to Vercel.
